# Monthly-Coastal-Temperature-Trends-in-Australia-from-2009-to-2012: Abstract (Read Me!)
This dataset focuses on monthly temperature data collected from coastal areas in Australia during the years 2009 to 2012. The main goal of this repository is to analyze and compare temperature patterns over time, such as identifying if there had been an increase or decrease in temperatures.

Understanding these changes is important because temperature trends can signal changes in climate and can affect marine and coastal ecosystems. The following data was cleaned and organized to calculate the average temperature for each month in 2009 and 2012, helping us to better understand climate variation in Australiaâ€™s coastal zones.

## How to Access the Data

To find and download the original data:

First, you want to visit the Open Acess to Ocean Data Network Portal:   
[Open Acess to Ocean Data Network Portal](https://portal.aodn.org.au/search)

 Next use the search filters or select the following variables (or substrates):  
   - Air Temperature  
   - Atmospheric Pressure  
   - Dew-point Temperature  
   - Earth-relative Wind Direction  
   - Earth-relative Wind Speed  
   - Sea Temperature  
   - Wet-bulb Temperature

Then download the data as a csv file:
#####The CSV file includes extra summary rows labeled as "data points." You can remove these either by deleting the rows manually in Excel or by filtering them out when importing the file in Co-Lab.


>If you're unable to retrieve the CSV file, I've provided a cleaned version below, which I manually formatted using Excel:
