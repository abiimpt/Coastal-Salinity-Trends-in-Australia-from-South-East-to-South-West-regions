# Coastal Salinity Trends in Australia from South-East to South-West regions: Abstract (Read Me!) 
This dataset focuses on monthly sea-surface salinity (PSU) measured at several coastal locations in southern Australia. The main goal of this repository is to analyze and compare salinity patterns across different regions south-west and south-east, and southern sectors of our study area to see how coastal salinity varies spatially.  

Understanding these changes is important because shifts in salinity affect ocean circulation, marine life, and coastal ecosystems. The data have been cleaned and organized to calculate the average salinity in each region and the data comes from 2009 to 2012 years, allowing us to assess both seasonal cycles and regional differences in coastal salinity along Australiaâ€™s southern shore.
## How to Access the Data

To find and download the original data:

First, you want to visit the Open Acess to Ocean Data Network Portal:   
[Open Acess to Ocean Data Network Portal](https://portal.aodn.org.au/search)

 Next use the search filters or select the following variables (or substrates):  
   - Air Temperature  
   - Atmospheric Pressure  
   - Dew-point Temperature  
   - Earth-relative Wind Direction  
   - Earth-relative Wind Speed  
   - Sea Temperature  
   - Wet-bulb Temperature

Then download the data as a csv file:
#####The CSV file includes extra summary rows labeled as "data points." You can remove these either by deleting the rows manually in Excel or by filtering them out when importing the file in Co-Lab.


>If you're unable to retrieve the CSV file, I've provided a cleaned version below, which I manually formatted using Excel:
