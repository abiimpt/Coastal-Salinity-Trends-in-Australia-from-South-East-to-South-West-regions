# Monthly-Coastal-Temperature-Trends-in-Australia-from-2009-to-2012
##Abstract (Read Me!)
This dataset focuses on monthly temperature data collected from coastal areas in Australia during the years 2009 to 2012. The main goal of this repository is to analyze and compare temperature patterns over time, such as identifying if there had been an increase or decrease in temperatures.

Understanding these changes is important because temperature trends can signal changes in climate and can affect marine and coastal ecosystems. The following data was cleaned and organized to calculate the average temperature for each month in 2009 and 2012, helping us to better understand climate variation in Australiaâ€™s coastal zones.
