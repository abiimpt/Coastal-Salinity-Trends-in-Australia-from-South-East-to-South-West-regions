# Coastal Salinity Trends in Australia from South-East to South-West regions: Abstract (Read Me!) 
This dataset focuses on sea-surface salinity (PSU) measurements collected from multiple coastal locations along southern Australia. The objective of this repository is to analyze and compare salinity patterns across different regions, specifically focusing on the south-west, south-east, and southern area. By examining salinity changes in these coastal regions, the dataset aims to explore how coastal salinity varies.

Understanding these shifts in salinity may help understand influence key oceanographic processes, including ocean circulation, nutrient distribution, and the health of marine ecosystems. Changes in salinity can also impact the distribution and behavior of marine life, which relies on stable salinity conditions for reproduction, feeding, and migration. Moreover, variations in salinity can affect coastal ecosystems, influencing habitats and human activities such as fishing and tourism. The data, spanning from 2009 to 2012, has been carefully cleaned and organized to allow for the calculation of average salinity values in each of the identified regions. By leveraging this dataset.

## How to Access the Data

To find and download the original data:

First, you want to visit the Open Acess to Ocean Data Network Portal:   
[Open Acess to Ocean Data Network Portal](https://portal.aodn.org.au/search)

 Next use the search filters or select the following variables (or substrates):  
   - Air Temperature  
   - Atmospheric Pressure  
   - Dew-point Temperature  
   - Earth-relative Wind Direction  
   - Earth-relative Wind Speed  
   - Sea Temperature  
   - Wet-bulb Temperature

Then download the data as a csv file:
#####The CSV file includes extra summary rows labeled as "data points." You can remove these either by deleting the rows manually in Excel or by filtering them out when importing the file in Co-Lab.


>If you're unable to retrieve the CSV file, I've provided a cleaned version below, which I manually formatted using Excel:
